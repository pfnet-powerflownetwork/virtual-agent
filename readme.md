# Welcome to PFNET: Power Flow Network üöÄ

The **Power Flow Network (PFNET)** is an innovative distributed system for sharing and managing computational power. This platform allows users to connect their machines, contribute their idle computational resources, and get rewarded while supporting tasks that require high-performance computing.

At the heart of PFNET lies **PFNETAgent**, a virtual agent responsible for orchestrating the flow of tasks and computational resources. But PFNET isn‚Äôt just a single agent‚Äîit‚Äôs an ecosystem of components working together to ensure efficiency, reliability, and engagement. Let‚Äôs dive into the architecture and explore the key elements!

## üåü PFNETAgent: The Central Brain  

The **PFNETAgent** is the core of PFNET, managing the nodes, task queues, and resource allocation across the network. It ensures that all connected machines operate harmoniously to maximize efficiency.

Here‚Äôs how a node is registered in the system:  

```java
public void registerNode(String nodeId, int capacity) {
    nodes.put(nodeId, new Node(nodeId, capacity));
    System.out.println("[INFO] Node registered: " + nodeId + " with capacity " + capacity);
}
```

This agent also monitors tasks and allocates them to available nodes based on their computational capacity. It uses real-time data from other components to optimize operations dynamically.

## üìä NetworkMonitor: Keeping the Network Healthy  

The **NetworkMonitor** supervises the health and performance of PFNET in real-time. It tracks metrics like node activity, connectivity, and load distribution. If something goes wrong, the monitor immediately flags the issue to the PFNETAgent for corrective action.

For example, this method scans for inactive nodes:  

```java
public void monitorNetwork() {
    nodes.forEach((nodeId, node) -> {
        if (!node.isActive()) {
            System.err.println("[ALERT] Node " + nodeId + " is inactive!");
        }
    });
}
```

This ensures that the network runs smoothly and any problems are quickly identified.

## ü§ñ SocialMediaBot: Engaging the Community  

The **SocialMediaBot** bridges the gap between PFNET and the wider world. It posts updates about the network's performance to platforms like Twitter or Mastodon, keeping users informed and attracting new contributors.

Here‚Äôs an example of how the bot generates a status update:  

```java
public String generateStatusUpdate(PFNETAgent agent) {
    int activeNodes = agent.getNodes().size();
    int pendingTasks = agent.getTaskQueue().size();
    return String.format(
        "PFNET Status: %d active nodes, %d tasks pending. Join us and contribute your computational power!",
        activeNodes, pendingTasks);
}
```

Beyond sharing updates, the bot analyzes data from the network, providing valuable insights to PFNETAgent for better decision-making.

## üîí AuthenticationService: Ensuring Security  

Security is vital in a distributed network. The **AuthenticationService** ensures that only authorized users can access PFNET. It manages user registrations, login credentials, and session tokens.  

Here‚Äôs how the service logs in a user and issues a session token:  

```java
public String loginUser(String username, String password) {
    String hashedPassword = userCredentials.get(username);
    if (hashedPassword == null || !hashedPassword.equals(hashPassword(password))) {
        System.err.println("[ERROR] Invalid credentials for username: " + username);
        return null;
    }

    String sessionToken = generateSessionToken(username);
    activeSessions.put(sessionToken, username);
    System.out.println("[INFO] User logged in successfully: " + username);
    return sessionToken;
}
```

With this layer of security, PFNET ensures safe and reliable access for its users.

## üåê Bringing It All Together  

The PFNET ecosystem is designed to be modular, scalable, and efficient. Here‚Äôs how the components work together:  

1. **PFNETAgent** integrates data from the **NetworkMonitor** to manage tasks dynamically.  
2. **SocialMediaBot** promotes network activity and provides real-time insights.  
3. **AuthenticationService** ensures that access to the system is secure.  

This synergy allows PFNET to operate as a cohesive and robust distributed network for computational power sharing.
